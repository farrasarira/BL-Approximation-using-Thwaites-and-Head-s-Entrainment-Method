# Boundary-Layer-Approximation-using-Thwaites-and-Head-s-Entrainment-Method

The approximation of boundary layer using both Thwaites method and Head's Entrainment is done in this project. The idea to approximate the boundary layer is by dividing the flow into two regimes: inviscid flow and viscous flow. The panel method is used to analyze the inviscid flow, while Thwaites method is used to analyze the laminar viscous flow and Head's Entrainment method is used to analyze the turbulent boundary layer. The viscous-inviscid interaction method is applied since the displacement of boundary layer affects inviscid flow. The result shows that the present method can predict the boundary layer accurately in the laminar flow regime. The trend of boundary layer displacement thickness and momentum thickness is similar to XFOIL results in the laminar flow regime. Unfortunately, the present method can not predict accurately the boundary layer on high angle of attack condition.
